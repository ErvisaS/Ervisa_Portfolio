Project 1:  Cyclictic Case Study

 About Cyclistic:

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The Problem: 
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.The objective is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers.  Casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
